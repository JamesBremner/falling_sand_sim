Falling Sand Simulator
This project is a falling sand simulator implemented in C++ using the SFML library for graphical rendering. It employs a 2D grid to manage the physics of falling and interacting particles, such as sand. The simulator allows users to observe the behavior of particles as they fall under gravity, demonstrating basic sandbox physics through simple algorithms and standard C++ libraries.

Requirements:
- Visual Studio Code with the CMake Tools extension installed
- CMake installed for building the project
- Dependencies (SFML) are automatically fetched via CMake FetchContent

Build and Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. The CMake Tools extension will automatically detect the project and configure the build environment.
4. Press F7 or click the "Build" button in CMake Tools to start the build process. CMake will handle dependencies and compile the project.
5. Once the build is complete, run the program directly from the terminal or through the VSCode interface.
